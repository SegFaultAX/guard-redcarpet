# Guard::Redcarpet

[Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) extension for Markdown using the
[Redcarpet](https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet) gem. There is an existing
[guard-markdown](https://github.com/darwalenator/guard-markdown) gem, but it
uses Kramdown.

## Install

This gem is an extension of Guard.

Installation (command-line):

    gem install guard-redcarpet

Or via your Gemfile:

    gem 'guard-redcarpet'

Add the template to your Guardfile:

    guard init redcarpet

## Options

You should familiarize yourself with the Redcarpet documentation before
exploring some of the advanced features of this gem.

### Output directory

The default Guard template watches for .html.md and .html.markdown files:

    guard 'redcarpet' do
      watch(/^.+(\.html\.markdown)$/)
      watch(/^.+(\.html\.md)$/)
    end

You can override the output directory with the `output` option:

    guard 'redcarpet', :output => 'compiled' do
      watch(/^.+(\.html\.markdown)$/)
      watch(/^.+(\.html\.md)$/)
    end

### Markdown and Render options

Options for the `Redcarpet::Markdown` and `Redcarpet::Render::HTML` objects can be
provided via the `markdown_options` and `render_options` options respectively.

    guard 'redcarpet', :markdown_options => { :strikethrough => true } do
      watch(/^.+(\.html\.markdown)$/)
      watch(/^.+(\.html\.md)$/)
    end


    guard 'redcarpet', :render_options => { :no_links => true } do
      watch(/^.+(\.html\.markdown)$/)
      watch(/^.+(\.html\.md)$/)
    end

Consult the Redcarpet 2.0 documentation for details.

## Special Thanks

Much of the code for this gem was a direct port of the [guard-haml
gem](https://github.com/manufaktor/guard-haml) by [Immanuel
HÃ¤ussermann](https://github.com/manufaktor)
